# git_test
My first GitHub repo!
Hello Odin!

----------

Changed repo name to "my_sandbox" to make a place for my learning space.

----------

2024-07-18 All notes regarding previously listed coding project are now in "decoder" directory.
This has become my overall sandbox for coding projects and learning resources, as well as
samples of code I've written myself. Most of the samples were inspired by learning activities,
but none of them were direct results of assignments or projects.

I may make separate repositories for the different language sandboxes in the future, but for
now, it makes sense to keep them all in one place.
