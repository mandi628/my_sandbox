# develop a function name 'decode(message_file)'. The 'message_file' argument is a string
# containing the file path for a .txt file that has an encoded message. When the function
# is called, it should read the file specified by its argument, decode the message, and
# return (not print) the decoded message as a string in a specific format,
    
# The key to decoding the message is to use the words corresponding to the numbers at the
# end of each pyramid line (in this example, 1, 3, and 6). The decoded message is formed by
# taking these words and separating them by individual spaces, with no extra characters. You
# should ignore all the other words.

def decode(message_file):
	#message filepath lookup
	if message.startswith(%d):
		return(words.txt[2:])

msg1 = "  1"
msg2 = " 2 3"
msg3 = "4 5 6"

key1 = 3 love
key2 = 6 computer
key3 = 2 dogs
key4 = 4 cats
key5 = 1 i
key6 = 5 you



# 1. Read the message file
# 2. Pull the last character in each line of the message file
# 3. Look up the number in the key file
# 4. Return the corresponding word from the key file.
